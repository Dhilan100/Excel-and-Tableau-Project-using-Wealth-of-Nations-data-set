# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the data and visuals for a data analysis project focusing on the "Wealth of Nations" dataset. The project involves data cleaning, filtering, sorting, and visualization using Excel and Tableau.

## Excel Analysis

In the Excel part of the project, I performed the following tasks:

- Cleaned and formatted the "Wealth of Nations" dataset.
- Applied filters and sorting to organize the data.
- Created various charts and visualizations to analyze different aspects of the dataset.
- Protected the Excel file to ensure data integrity and security.

## Tableau Dashboard

In the Tableau part of the project, I imported the cleaned dataset and created a dashboard consisting of four visualizations:

1. Top 20 Countries by Highest GDP per Capita: Column chart
2. Top 20 Countries by Smartphone User: Table chart
3. Top 20 Countries by Life Expectancy: Symbol maps
4. Comparing GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy by Top 20 Countries with Highest Smartphone Users: Tree maps
5. Comparing GDP per Capita and Smartphone users by Top 20 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy: Bar Chart
